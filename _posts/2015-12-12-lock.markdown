==> LockMethodData can be compared as electronic lock or traditional lock, it
	specifies:
	--> the meaning of each lock mode, that is to say, which lock mode
	conflicts with other lock modes;
	--> whether this kind of lock is transactional, that is to say, whether
	released at transaction end;

	3 important fields of this structure:
	--> numLockModes
	--> transactional
	--> conflictTab: this is an array of bitmask, each bitmask records the
	conflicts of one lockmode with other lockmodes;

	All LockMethodData instances are hard coded in lock.c, 3 in total, stored in
	const array *LockMethods*, and these 3 are almost the same, the only difference
	is that USER_LOCKMETHOD is not transactional;

==> We can only discuss lock mode on the context of a specific lock target;
	there are three classes of lock target(internally more than 3):
	--> table level: 8 lock levels/modes(these 8 are all for table level, though
					 name has *row* literally; the names are just historical,
					 the core idea is the level and conflict relationships)
	--> row level: 2 modes, exclusive and share
	--> page level: 2 modes, exclusive and share

	Basically, one command may acquire all these 3 classes of locks, for
	example, SELECT FOR UPDATE would first acquire ROW SHARE mode lock on the
	table, and then acquire exclusive mode lock on row level for that logical
	row(didn't trace for page level);

	Lock should be talked in the scope of transaction, a transaction would never
	conflict itself; Once the locks are acquired, normally they are released at
	the end of transaction; But if a lock is acquired after establishing a
	savepoint, the lock is released immediately if the savepoint is rolled back
	to. The same applys for locks acquired within a PL/pgSQL exception block:
	an error escape from the block releases locks acquired within it.
	One exception here: page level locks are released immediately after a
	physical row is read or written. 

	Row level locks do not affect read, they block only writers to the
	same row. That is to say, read does not need to acqure row level locks, and
	write specific rows would acquire exclusive row level locks; that is where
	MVCC works, and why "read does not block write, write does not block read".
	A question is: why we need row level share lock if read does not need to
	acquire row level lock at all? just for SQL level feature(SELECT FOR SHARE)?

	Reference: http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.4/static/explicit-locking.html

==> PostgreSQL automatically detects deadlock and resolves them by
	aborting one of the transactions involved, allowing the other(s) to complete.
	(Exactly which transaction will be aborted is difficult to predict and should
 	not be relied upon.)

	Deadlocks can occur on both table level and row level(usally page level is
	not included in discussion, so I am not sure)

	The best defense against deadlocks is generally to avoid them by being
	certain that all applications using a database acquire locks on multiple
	objects in a consistent order.
