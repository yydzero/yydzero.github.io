==> LOCKTAG uniquely identifies a resource to be locked;

==> LOCK structure descripts the live locking situation of a target resource,
	that is to say, which processes acquired the lock on this target resource,
	and which processes are waiting for the lock on this target resource;
	--> LOCKTAG tag
	--> LOCKMASK grantMask: all the lock modes that have been granted on this target
		resource;
	--> LOCKMASK waitMask: all the lock modes wait to be granted on this target
		resource;
	--> SHM_QUEUE procLocks: all the procs that have been granted the lock on
		the target resource, not in PGPROC list form, but in LOCKPROC list form,
		here SHM_QUEUE is the *head* of the list;
		--> SHM_QUEUE is a structure widely used for share memory code, it is a
			part of the share memory double linked list implementation; each element
			in the linked list is a SHM_QUEUE structure, there is no data field in
			SHM_QUEUE, the pointer of the data can be get by using the offset and
			the pointer of the SHM_QUEUE element, so by this way, the linked list
			functionality is abstracted out;

			One more thing worth mention is, for structures to be in share memory,
			we have no pointer as a field, because same share memory region can be
			mapped to different address in different processes, so we use strucuture
			itself and offset to avoid memory corruption;

			Another thing is: when SHM_QUEUE is a field of a structure, when
			perform insert/delete of list, only the SHM_QUEUE would be adjusted;
			when perform next/prev of list, the offset of SHM_QUEUE in the
			structure is considered, so the returned pointer is for the
			structure instead of the SHM_QUEUE; so better to put the SHM_QUEUE
			as the last field of the structure to make use of this
			implementation, but you can put it as the first field also, that is
			easier; Note that, SHM_QUEUE can only be used as a field of a
			structure, which is to be allocated from share memory;
	--> PROC_QUEUE waitProcs: all the procs waiting to be granted lock on target
		resource, in PGPROC list form, here PROC_QUEUE is the *head* of the list;
		--> PROC_QUEUE is a wrapper for SHM_QUEUE with an additional field to
			record the size of the list;
	--> int requested[MAX_LOCKMODES]: record numbers of locks requested for each
		lock mode, including the granted locks;
	--> int nRequested: total number together;
	--> int granted[MAX_LOCKMODES]: record numbers of locks waiting for each
		lock mode;
	--> int nGranted: total number together;
	--> each process/transaction would be counted only once for multiple grabs
		on a particular lock(LOCALLOCK works here);

==> Actually, there is no need for PROCLOCK structure if no deadlock detection,
	simply use PROC_QUEUE for PGPROC is OK;

	Each PROCLOCK is a map of a PGPROC and a LOCK, where PGPROC can be process
	granted the lock or the process waiting for the lock; PROCLOCKTAG is combination
	of PROC and LOCK;

	XXX A question is: why PROCLOCKTAG can contain pointer field? The answer in the
	comments is: We can use pointers here because the PROCLOCKTAG need only be
	unique for the lifespan of the PROCLOCK, and it will never outlive the lock
	or the proc. This is not persuasive, provide that one process inserts a
	PROCLOCKTAG using its address of a LOCK, then another process is iterating
	the ProcLockHash and reading the LOCK pointer in the PROCLOCKTAG, the LOCK
	pointer does not mean anything;

	Fields:
	--> PROCLOCKTAG tag
	--> LOCKMASK holdMask: lock modes granted of the specific lock in tag for
		this process;
	--> LOCKMASK releaseMask: temp workspace for LockReleaseAll();
	--> SHM_QUEUE lockLink and SHM_QUEUE procLink: add this structure into
		linked lists; that is to say, *for each* PGPROC, there would be a linked
		list of PROCLOCK recording the lock *granted or waiting for*, i.e, myProcLocks
		field in PGPROC; and for each LOCK, there would be a linked list of
		PROCLOCK recording the processes which *has acquired* the lock, i.e,
		procLocks field in LOCK structure; these two SHM_QUEUE is just an
		*element* in a list, not a head;
	----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	GP-specific fields for resource queue
	----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	--> int nLocks: total number of times this lock is acquired by this process.
		Should be moved to LOCALLOCK? provide that share memory lock only counts
		once for each process/transaction.
		Answer: no, LOCALLOCK of resource lock is almost not used, and nLocks
		should be in share memory as it may be referenced by other backends;

	--> SHM_QUEUE portalLinks: *head*, since a process would acquire a single resource
		queue lock several times, each time with a ResPortalIncrement structure,
		we link these increments into a list, and the head is put here;
		
		Whether nLocks equals to the length of this list? 
		Answer: these two has no relationship at all! nLocks means the number of
		portals which have acquired the resource lock, while the length of the
		portalLinks means the number of portals waiting to get the resource
		lock;

		TODO: Should restrict these two fields to specific resource queue lock
		to reduce share memory usage?
		Answer: not that urgent to do this currently;
		
		Should be moved to LOCALLOCK also?
		Answer: cannot be moved into LOCALLOCK, because this information should
		be exposed to other processes, so must reside in share memory, though it
		violates the design of PROCLOCK a little bit;

		--> All ResPortalIncrements are in share memory as a hash table, with
			global variable ResPortalIncrementHash points to it; the unique
			identifier for a ResPortalIncrement is pid and portal id, that is to
			say, for each process, there would be a list of ResPortalIncrements,
			with head in PROCLOCK, and each element is for a portal, ordinarily,
			there would be only one element for a process, if there are extended
			queries, then more than one elements would be in the list;
